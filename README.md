# Commercial Expiry Service

This Play app produces a Kinesis stream of content items whose commercial expiry status has changed recently.  Each entry in the stream consists of a content ID and a boolean expiry status value.

See [Config](../master/app/commercialexpiry/Config.scala) for the required configuration settings.
